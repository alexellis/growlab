* [Live stream "Grow your own food with Raspberry Pi" - Alex Ellis & Richard Gee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta_LBKpI5-0)

## How it works

1) Read the launch blog post: [Join the Grow Lab Challenge](https://blog.alexellis.io/the-grow-lab-challenge/).
3) Decide you're taking part by sending a PR and adding yourself to the "growlab Technicians" section below.
2) Find or buy the required components for the experiments you want to take part in (read all of this file to learn more)
4) Build your own `#growlab` using one of the designs, or customise it. And start growing and recording a timelapse.
5) Use the [#growlab hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23growlab&src=typed_query) and share as many pictures as you like.
6) Send a Pull Request and link to each Tweet to unlock each level.
7) At the conclusion of the growing period, we'll send some prizes from OpenFaaS Ltd and Pimoroni to entries at random for different tiers.

> Note: Growlab 2021 concludes Sunday 3rd October to mark Harvest Festival in the United Kingdom.

Prizes to be provided by: [OpenFaaS Ltd](https://openfaas.com) and [Pimoroni](https://www.pimoroni.com). Want to sponsor or provide prizes? Send an email to [alex@openfaas.com](mailto:alex@openfaas.com)

### Unlock each level

Before you get started with your build, send a PR to list yourself as a "lab technician".

Bronze - assemble your `#growlab` using one of the recommend designs or customise it. Tweet a photo of your build fully assembled.

Silver - install the software and capture your first photo of your seed tray or pots. Tweet the photo.

Gold - Wait until at least one of your seeds has germinated and grown into a seedling - around 2-3cm in height. Tweet the photo taken by the timelapse software.

Platinum - use the [phototimer](https://github.com/alexellis/phototimer) or seeds2 software to capture images over 14 days. Compile the images into a timelapse and upload it to YouTube. We recommend one photo every 10 minutes. Feel free to exclude any photos prior to the seeds germinating. Tweet a link to the video.

## Growlab Technicians

Technicians work in laboratories, and you are no different, so if you've bought your kit, or have decided to join, then add your details below so that we can encourage each other and see how many people are participating. If you don't have a Twitter or GitHub handle just put N/a.

## Official growlab apps

We have three experiments that you can take part in:

1) [phototimer - Record images for the timelapse contest](https://github.com/alexellis/phototimer)

    You'll need a Raspberry Pi Zero or greater with a camera module. This is required for the contest.

2) [live preview app - Generate and upload a live-preview with sensor data growlab app](/app)

    You'll need a Raspberry Pi Zero or greater with a camera module. If you have a BME280 sensor or BMP280 sensor, then you can add sensor data to the live preview image. This is optional for the contest, but recommended so that you can share with the community.

3) [data-logger - Capture environment data and plot on a Grafana dashboard](/data-logger)

    You'll need an RPi 3 or 4 to run the time series database, and dashboard. Then you can attach a sensor to this unit directly, or have a number of other Raspberry Pi Zeros or greater with the BME280 sensor or BMP280 sensor.

    The data-logger does not require you to grow any plants, you can even use it to monitor your home and garden temperatures during the year. This experiment is optional.

### Focusing your camera

Some cameras like the HQ camera are variable focus, the cheaper lenses can also have their glue broken to enable them to close focus.

Low latency with built-in web-browser:

["Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera setup for low-latency Video Conferencing"](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera-setup-for-low-latency-video-conferencing/)

Quick and functional:

```bash
# On your Raspberry Pi
raspivid -t 0 -w 1280 -h 720 -fps 10 -o - | nc -lkv4 8080

# On your computer, enter this URL into VLC under "Network Stream"
# Replace with your Raspberry Pi's IP
tcp/h264://192.168.0.53:8080
```

### Making your timelapse

If you're using phototimer, then you can run the following with ffmpeg. It's advised that you copy the images to your PC before running the command since the Raspberry Pi Zero is rather slow at crunching videos.

```bash
echo $(echo $(find ./Desktop/image/ | sort -V|grep jpg)) | xargs cat | ffmpeg  -framerate 10 -f image2pipe -vcodec mjpeg -i - -vcodec libx264 out.mp4
```

iMovie is also relatively easy to use, by dragging the images into the timeline and changing the time between images to ~ 0.1s

Here's a sample from 9th-22nd April you can watch on YouTube:

### Extra points and taking things further

![Self-watering system](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzZ1vDsXMAgNQKF?format=jpg&name=small)
> A self-watering system

* Overlay temperature and humidity data with a Bosch BME280 or BMP280 sensor
* Add a self-watering system with a small pump and capacitive soil sensor
* Try a garden RGB grow-light to give your seeds a little more help
* Experiment with hydroponics
* Install your lab in an outdoor greenhouse, shed or cold-frame
* Use a light sensor / LDR or UV sensor measure available light
* Try a suitable solar panel and battery capacity to run your experiment outdoors or in a room without a socket
